Subject: [PATCH v2] USB-Audio: Blacklist iec958 for some USB devices

Some common USB devices are analog only, so prevent the digital
devices from being opened. This simplifies probing the device
in PulseAudio.

I have a "Logitech USB Headset" myself, the "Logitech Web Camera"
was reported by Raymond Yau, and the "Blue Snowball" was reported by
Andy Whitcroft.
