libasound3
----------
libasound2 includes /usr/bin/aserver which should be in a libasound2-bin
package.

We build libasound2-dev, making it appear that we are prepared to
support multiple simultaneous -dev packages in the future.  However,
libasound2-dev uses generically named directories such as
/usr/include/alsa/.  A future libasound3-dev should probably use
/usr/include/asound3/ instead.
