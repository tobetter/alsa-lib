Old versus new PCM API (values returned using indirect pointers)
================================================================

From the binary compatibility view, there is no change. For compilation,
1.0 ALSA applications do not need any change. The older applications must
use this include sequence:

#define ALSA_PCM_OLD_HW_PARAMS_API
#define ALSA_PCM_OLD_SW_PARAMS_API
#include <alsa/asoundlib.h>

If you use already the new API, you may remove old defines selecting
this API, because they are no longer used:

#define ALSA_PCM_NEW_HW_PARAMS_API
#define ALSA_PCM_NEW_SW_PARAMS_API
